The Shopping App by Desmond Oseme is designed to offer a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience, meeting the specified requirements. It leverages the fake store API from https://fakestoreapi.com/ for resource consumption, ensuring automated parsing and building of JSON responses using Gson.

Upon launching, the app presents an authentication page for users to sign up or log in using their credentials. Successful login stores user details and redirects to the home page displaying product categories via a RecyclerView. Selecting a category reveals the products within, allowing users to view descriptions and add items to their cart with specified quantities.

The cart functionality calculates the total purchase amount and facilitates order placement, providing notifications on order status. Users can also access their order history, view detailed order information, and manage their profile, including a random circular profile image and a logout option.

The app integrates a ViewPager2 with a bottom TabLayout for smooth navigation among Shop, Cart, Orders, and Profile sections. Additionally, it incorporates a map fragment based on user GPS coordinates from the profile.
